# PTM
This GitHub repository includes the data files and code used to generate the figures for the manuscript "Proteome-wide analysis of functional interactions and regulatory relationships among protein modifications in colorectal cancer".
Data Structure
# The data structure includes two folders:
R: This folder contains the main plotting code, code for calculating the EMT score, and code for mediation analysis. It includes a subfolder named data which contains the input and output data.
Python: This folder contains the code for calculating interactions. It includes a subfolder named data which contains the input and output data.
# Additional Notes:
This study uses the two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to calculate the EMT score (EMBO Mol Med. 2014 Oct;6(10):1279-93). The code used for this calculation was created by Priyanka (Front Bioeng Biotechnol. 2020 Mar 20:8:220.) and can be found at https://github.com/priyanka8993/EMT_score_calculation.
